# Troubleshooting Opal and DataSHIELD
There are two main areas of interest in this troubleshooting guide:
- Opal management
- R and DataSHIELD developement

## Opal management
Issues concerning data import and export in Opal

### Importing data

**Source data does not except “≥”**
If you have a value label with sign “≥”, Opal will not upload (error “File contains invalid characters at row '910'. Please make sure the file is a valid SPSS file and that you have chosen the correct character set.”)

If you change this to “=>”,  problem solved



## R and DataSHIELD development
