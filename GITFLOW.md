# GIT-flow
In the following tutorial you can practise the basics of working with version control. In this case GIT.
There are a few main principles you have to understand.

- repositories (a set of files managed by GIT, local or remote)
- remote repository (the repostiroy where you work on together)
- commit in a repository (creating change-sets)
- pulling commits from a repository
- pushing commits to a repository

## Changing files
When you changed a file in your repository GIT noticed it and will ask you what to do with it.

So for example:

You are writing a script: import.R.

- Create a new file

- Change the file

- Save the file

_ Give the file a name

- Check in the commit-box what changes you made

## Commiting files
When you changed a fileset that is of use for other people to or you are just finished with it you can commit it into the repository. Be adviced once you commit a fileset you have need to push it as well to get it into the remote repository.

- Click on "commit"
